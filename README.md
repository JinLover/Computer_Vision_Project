### Installation

This project is based on a [Yolo-v3](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3) repository, which is based on a [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).

However, official installation process written in original repository is error-prone.

It is strongly suggested to use the `requirements.yaml` file to generate a Conda venv.

### Execution

Please refer to the `tutorials.ipynb` file for the execution process.
